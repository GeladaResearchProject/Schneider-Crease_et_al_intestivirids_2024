# Schneider-Crease_et_al_intestivirids_2024

We analyzed fecal samples from infants and mothers in this population across the infancy period for richness and presence of crAssphage-like viruses (family Intestiviridae). Eight intestivirid genomes were identified based on terminal redundancy representing six unique variants (<98% intergenomic similarity) closely related to the human crAssphage.
